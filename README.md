# Obsidian Planner

This is a Planner Plugin for Obsidian, copied from the official sample-plugin github (https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin) (https://obsidian.md).
It uses React and TailwindCSS to create a versatile and beautiful userinterface.

### Planned Features
- A todolist with task (due-date is given)
- A calendar
- Task-dragging from todolist to calendar and back
- Dragging of events inside calendar
- A traveltime system
  - Tasks have locations
  - locations are connected in a weighted graph, representing traveltime
  - Tasks can only be placed into the calendar if respecting traveltime
- Smart propositions of timemanagement, considering currently unplanned Tasks

Those goals are very ambitious so it may very well be possible that they wont be implemented in the near future since our time is limited
